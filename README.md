_Post-hoc tinkering with my dissertation dataset_

This repo contains some work on my dissertation dataset. You can read the dissertation at [https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/138452](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/138452).

I collected the data from the _Inscriptiones Christianae Urbis Romae_, edited by Antonio Ferrua et al.
